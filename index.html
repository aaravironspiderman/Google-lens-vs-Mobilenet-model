        <br>
    </ol>
         <h4> It is logical that Google lens is useful to us.
              <br>
              I have tested 10 objects which lens got them more accurate
              but mobilenet gives only a simplish name,
              <br>
              so I advice that Google lens is the one for R-Kart.
              <br>
              Thank you! Aarav Saxena.
